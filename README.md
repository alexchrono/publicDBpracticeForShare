# Database Relationships & Queries Exercise

Welcome to the database relationships and queries exercise! This exercise will challenge your understanding of SQL relationships using Flask-SQLAlchemy and help you practice SQL queries using ORM techniques.

## Getting Started

### Set Up Your Environment:
1. If you see a `venv` directory, delete it:
   ```bash
   rm -r venv
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pipenv install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Establish Relationships:
1. Navigate to the `app/models` directory.
2. Open the `models.py` file and follow the instructions to establish the relationships as per the comments.

## Testing Your Work

### Seed the Database:
Before testing your queries, ensure that your database is seeded:
```bash
python seeder.py
```

### Test Your Queries:
Once you've established the relationships, you're ready to test your queries:
```bash
python GOHERE.py
```
This will provide feedback on the correctness of your queries based on the expected relationships and data in the database.

## Completion:
Once you've successfully seeded your database and your queries are providing the expected results, congratulations! You've completed the exercise.

the best part is this a git repository and you can reset and start all over again.   Have fun .
